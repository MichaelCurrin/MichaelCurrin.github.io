I am a **Senior Software Engineer**. I'm a backend developer turned fullstack. 

I work at **2U** - an EdTech company which partners with universities like Oxford and MIT to bring short courses, degrees, and bootcamps to online students globally. Recently, it acquired edX.

My first love is Python. I build with Vue, Jekyll, Go, and a lot more. In the last year, I've had more opportunities to architect solutions and to lead projects, so look forward to keep up with that.

I like to **learn** from others and to giving **coaching** - whether at meetup events, on blogs, on online forums or through one-on-one video chats.
