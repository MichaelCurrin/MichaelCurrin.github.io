I am a **Senior Software Engineer**. I'm a backend developer turned fullstack. I
work at **2U** - an EdTech company which partners with universities like Oxford
and MIT to bring short courses, degrees, and bootcamps to online students
globally.

I love to build automation tools and data science projects using **Python** and
sometimes I use it as my backend. Most of my spare time is spent making websites with **JavaScript** (using Vue)
or static site generators (like Jekyll). I'm also learning **Go**.

I like to **learn** from others and to giving **coaching** - whether at meetup events, on blogs, on online
forums or through one-on-one video chats. I've even dabbled with hosting live coding sessions on
YouTube.

I'm also into:

- Test-Driven Development
- clean code
- software architecture
- databases
- consuming and build APIs
- contributing to open source projects
