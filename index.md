I am a **Senior Software Engineer** with backend and fullstack experience.

My first love is Python. I build with Vue, Jekyll, Go, and a lot more. In the last year, I've had opportunities to architect solutions and to lead projects, so look forward to keep up with that.

I like to **learn** from others and to giving **coaching**. Whether through hackathons, conferences, blogs, online forums or through one-on-one video chats (like with [Lunchclub][]).

I work at **2U** - an EdTech company which partners with universities like Oxford and MIT to bring short courses, degrees, and bootcamps to online students globally. Recently, it acquired edX.
