I am a **Senior Software Engineer** at **2U** - an EdTech company which partners with universities like Oxford
and MIT to bring short courses, degrees and bootcamps to online students globally.

I love to build automation tools and data science projects with **Python**. Most of my spare time is
spent making websites with **JavaScript** or static site generators. I'm also learning **Go**.

I like to learn from others and to giving coaching - whether at meetup events, on blogs, on online
forums or through one-on-one video chats. I've even dabbled with hosting live coding sessions on
YouTube.
