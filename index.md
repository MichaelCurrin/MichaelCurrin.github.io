I am a **Senior Software Engineer** with Backend and Fullstack experience.

My first love is Python. I build with JavaScript, Vue, Jekyll, Go, and a lot more. In recent years, I've had opportunities to architect solutions and to lead projects.

I work in Amsterdam at a company in the energy and sustainability area.

I keep track of how to do things across many languages, frameworks, and operating systems by maintaining these sites which I created. They are open source too, if you want to request or submit a change.

- [Dev Cheatsheets](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/)
- [Code Cookbook](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/code-cookbook/)
- [Dev Resources](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-resources/)

I like to **learn** from others and to giving **coaching** to colleagues and aspiring developers. Whether through hackathons, conferences, blogs, online forums or through one-on-one video chats (like with [Lunchclub][]). I enjoy contributing to the open source community too.

In my spare time, I play guitar, play with robotic kits, perform improv comedy, and making digital art with AI.
