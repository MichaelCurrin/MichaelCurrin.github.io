I am a Senior Software Engineer at [2U](https://2u.com/) - a company which provides students
worldwide with online degrees. I use my fullstack experience in the _Marketing Systems_ team to
maintain the websites where prospective students sign up.

I love to build websites and automate tasks using the power of Python or JavaScript or another tool
that is right for the job. I think Go might be the next big thing to know. I like to teach and learn
from others both at community events and online.
