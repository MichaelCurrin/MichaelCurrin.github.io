## Who am I?

I am a **Senior Software Engineer** with Backend and Fullstack experience.

My first love is Python and my career is focused on Backend web development.

I like to **learn** from others and to giving **coaching** to colleagues and aspiring developers. Whether through hackathons, conferences, blogs, or tech meetups.

## Writing content

I keep track of how to do things across many languages, frameworks, and operating systems by maintaining these sites which I created. They are open source too, if you want to request or submit a change.
