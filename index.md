I am a **Senior Software Engineer** with Backend and Fullstack experience.

My first love is Python. I build with Vue, Jekyll, Go, and a lot more. In the last year, I've had opportunities to architect solutions and to lead projects, so look forward to keep up with that.

I like to **learn** from others and to giving **coaching**. Whether through hackathons, conferences, blogs, online forums or through one-on-one video chats (like with [Lunchclub][]).

I work at **RecoMed** - an online medical booking platform. Before that, I worked at 2U, an EdTech company delivering online education worldwide and that acquired EdX.
